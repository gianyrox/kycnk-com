# KYCnk - Know Your Customer No Knowledge

KYCnk (Know Your Customer No Knowledge) is a decentralized customer identification solution using blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It allows users to verify their identity while maintaining full control over their personal data. The service uses Solana wallet account hashes for verification, ensuring privacy and security by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. 

This repository contains the front-end code for the KYCnk landing page and provides users with a brief introduction to how the platform works.

## Features

- **Data Privacy:** Your personal data is never exposed to third parties.
- **Decentralized Approach:** Powered by Solana blockchain for maximum security.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Verifiable identity without revealing sensitive information.
- **Full Control:** You control who can access your data and what is shared.
  
### Key Sections on the Webpage

- **What is KYCnk?**: Overview of the KYCnk platform and how it ensures privacy using blockchain and ZKPs.
- **How It Works:** A step-by-step explanation of the platform's process.
- **Benefits of KYCnk:** Outlines the key advantages, including data privacy, decentralization, and ZKPs.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kycnk.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**

   Go to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd kycnk
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` File**

   You can open the `index.html` file in any browser to view the landing page. For a live environment, you can host it on any web server (e.g., using GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Apache).

4. **Optional: Setup Local Server for Live Preview**

   You can use a simple HTTP server for local testing:
   
   - **Python 3.x:** 
   
     If you have Python installed, run the following command:

     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```

   - **Node.js HTTP Server:**

     If you have Node.js installed, you can install `http-server`:

     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     ```

     And then run the server:

     ```bash
     http-server
     ```
